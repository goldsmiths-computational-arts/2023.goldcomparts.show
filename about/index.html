        <p>
            The 2023 Goldsmiths MA/MFA Computational Arts program invites you to Simbiosys, a degree-show exhibition
            considering
            the
            relationship between contemporary art, technology, and new media. Artists in the exhibition explore existing
            and
            potential modes of being and relationships between humans and technologies; Simbiosys is a neologism
            describing a
            new
            relationship which sees language dissolve into code, and logic transform to algorithm—a sort of
            technopomorphic
            phenomena which brings to the fore that which is created from the recursivity of human-technological
            interaction and
            collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            With more than 80 groundbreaking installations, immersive performances, virtual and augmented realities and
            world-building exercises, Simbiosys’ interdisciplinary nature acts as both a survey of contemporaneity and
            as an
            incubator for novel forms, methodologies, and concepts.
        </p>
        <p class="center" id="poem">
            Between the real, imaginary, and the symbolic. That which wanders through the very labyrinth it calls into
            being
            from an ever-shifting precipice of void; incessantly dispersing and collapsing, generating new models,
            modes, and ways of
            being in its recursivity which considers human-computer simbiosys through human-computer simbiosys.
